2017-03-16 - 3.1.0

The duplicate movies logic was modified to be more accurate. It now
checks by title only, which picks up duplicates where the year was
wrongly set on one of the copies.

This also raises false positives: movies that share the same name, but are
really completely different.

To handle this, I added a not duplicate functionality to manually mark these
rightful movies and have them not show up as duplicates

Also in this release:
- Fix build script
- Display agent version on startup
- Fix app title in browser tab
- Fetch data when entering a route
- Other bug fixes and general improvement
