Version 0.5.5 - 2016-01-21
    (front) Add sorting by count watched


Version 0.5.4 - 2016-01-18
    (front) Send the current time including timezone. The server does the conversion to UTC.
    (back) Close connections (to prevent too many open files)
    (back) Change logic of set watched time operation. Get current all_watched from the db, convert it to an array, add the incoming last watched, sort it, and use the lenght of the array as count_watched. The incoming watched time is converted to UTC for sanity
    (front) Add watched history to the ui
    (front) Fix control width


Version 0.5.3 - 2016-01-14
    - Publish correct message

    (mediagui) Ignore .out files


Version 0.5.0 - 2015-12-13
    - Implement distributed microservice architecture, where a service is running on the unraid host, collecting files and sending them back to the client, thus involving only one network roundtrip. This has brought down scanning times from 5 minutes to about 15 seconds :)

    - Fix duplicates feature
    - Add mask parameter to pb message
    - Define a new key for cover collection

    - Redefine import logic to be able to time the entire process by using a fan-in, fan-out pipeline strategy (based on waitgroups)
    - Add vendor folder to ignored files


Version 0.4.5 - 2015-10-12

    - Fix syntax error
    - Flatten src folder, so that import paths in go are simpler
    - Create server service
    - Refactor file/folder exists function into a separate file

    - Switch from httprouter to gin, because gin provides amenities that httprouter doesn't have (after all gin is a framework and httprouter is just a router)
    - Use update pubsub, which defines a new Mailbox structure, to allow for registering functions vs topics in the services

    - Refactor dto structs into their own package
    - Complete setMovieScore functionality
    - Fix issue where the page was scrolling to the top when setting movie score
